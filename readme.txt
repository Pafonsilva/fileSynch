Here is my script for syncing files using Python.

Make sure you the full path of the source folder, the replica folder, then the time in seconds you
want the script to update the replica folder, and the file path for the log file;

(example: python fileSynch.py C:\Users\fileSynch\fileSyncPy\source C:\Users\fileSynch\fileSyncPy\replica 10 C:\Users\fileSynch\fileSyncPy\log.txt)

Thank you for your time and consideration!
